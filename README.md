# sample-fusebox

Try to illustrate a bundle to provide a reusable library

To build, run :

```
$ npm run build
```

To start, run :

```
$ npm run start
```

Or both :

```
$ npm run build && npm run start
```

You should see this error :

```
Package not found whatwg-fetch
```

Although the library is in the dist file.

It's working with nodejs :

```
$ npm run start:node
```
